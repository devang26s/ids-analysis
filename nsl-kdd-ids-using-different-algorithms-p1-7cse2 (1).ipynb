Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as voted or didn’t vote, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1. In logistic regression, a logit transformation is applied on the odds—that is, the probability of success divided by the probability of failure. This is also commonly known as the log odds, or the natural logarithm of odds, and this logistic function is represented by the following formulas:\n\n<img src = https://miro.medium.com/max/888/1*D4CIwT2zRCcVq88iji6qYQ.png />\n\nIn this logistic regression equation, h is the dependent or response variable and x is the independent variable. The beta parameter, or coefficient, in this model is commonly estimated via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). This method tests different values of beta through multiple iterations to optimize for the best fit of log odds. All of these iterations produce the log likelihood function, and logistic regression seeks to maximize this function to find the best parameter estimate. Once the optimal coefficient (or coefficients if there is more than one independent variable) is found, the conditional probabilities for each observation can be calculated, logged, and summed together to yield a predicted probability. For binary classification, a probability less than .5 will predict 0 while a probability greater than 0 will predict 1.  After the model has been computed, it’s best practice to evaluate the how well the model predicts the dependent variable, which is called goodness of fit. \n\n#### Binary logistic regression:\n\nIn this approach, the response or dependent variable is dichotomous in nature—i.e. it has only two possible outcomes (e.g. 0 or 1). Some popular examples of its use include predicting if an e-mail is spam or not spam or if a tumor is malignant or not malignant. Within logistic regression, this is the most commonly used approach, and more generally, it is one of the most common classifiers for binary classification.\n\n#### Multinomial logistic regression:\n\nIn this type of logistic regression model, the dependent variable has three or more possible outcomes; however, these values have no specified order.  For example, movie studios want to predict what genre of film a moviegoer is likely to see to market films more effectively. A multinomial logistic regression model can help the studio to determine the strength of influence a person's age, gender, and dating status may have on the type of film that they prefer. The studio can then orient an advertising campaign of a specific movie toward a group of people likely to go see it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"lr = LogisticRegression().fit(x_train, y_train)\nevaluate_classification(lr, \"Logistic Regression\", x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-06T07:32:32.865643Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-11-06T07:32:32.865934Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-06T07:32:37.607280Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-06T07:32:32.865902Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-06T07:32:37.606254Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##  k-nearest neighbors\nThe k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.

In 2-dimensional space, this hyper-plane is nothing but a line. In SVM, we plot each data item in the dataset in an N-dimensional space, where N is the number of features/attributes in the data. Next, find the optimal hyperplane to separate the data. So by this, you must have understood that inherently, SVM can only perform binary classification (i.e., choose between two classes). However, there are various techniques to use for multi-class problems. Support Vector Machine for Multi-CLass Problems To perform SVM on multi-class problems, we can create a binary classifier for each class of the data. The two results of each classifier will be :\n\n* The data point belongs to that class OR\n* The data point does not belong to that class.\n\n<img src=https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Fqswkk7bY0_7EhTgbPWNOexWWzzDplNKYc1bJl6MI_edNVdwXnWI5xkoSyl7SxFHLLAWlW1AIEhWF2ilVvThzuU0HoPBNF79HsPezpXnKTv3DCFnD9ZeVPLmR828_JXpv5cB35TL width=600/>\n\nFor example, in a class of fruits, to perform multi-class classification, we can create a binary classifier for each fruit. For say, the ‘mango’ class, there will be a binary classifier to predict if it IS a mango OR it is NOT a mango. The classifier with the highest score is chosen as the output of the SVM. SVM for complex (Non Linearly Separable) SVM works very well without any modifications for linearly separable data. Linearly Separable Data is any data that can be plotted in a graph and can be separated into classes using a straight line.\n\nWe use Kernelized SVM for non-linearly separable data. Say, we have some non-linearly separable data in one dimension. We can transform this data into two dimensions and the data will become linearly separable in two dimensions. This is done by mapping each 1-D data point to a corresponding 2-D ordered pair. So for any non-linearly separable data in any dimension, we can just map the data to a higher dimension and then make it linearly separable. This is a very powerful and general transformation. A kernel is nothing but a measure of similarity between data points. The kernel function in a kernelized SVM tells you, that given two data points in the original feature space, what the similarity is between the points in the newly transformed feature space. There are various kernel functions available, but two are very popular :\n\n* Radial Basis Function Kernel (RBF): The similarity between two points in the transformed feature space is an exponentially decaying function of the distance between the vectors and the original input space as shown below. RBF is the default kernel used in SVM.\n\n* Polynomial Kernel: The Polynomial kernel takes an additional parameter, ‘degree’ that controls the model’s complexity and computational cost of the transformation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"lin_svc = svm.LinearSVC().fit(x_train, y_train)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-06T07:32:37.610070Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-06T07:32:37.611447Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-06T07:32:37.611152Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-06T07:32:37.611187Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"evaluate_classification(lin_svc, \"Linear SVC(LBasedImpl)\", x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-11-06T07:32:37.613179Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-11-06T07:32:37.614089Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-11-06T07:32:37.613814Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-11-06T07:32:37.613834Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Decision Tree\nDecision Tree is the most powerful and popular tool for classification and prediction. A Decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure, where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label. \n\n<img src= https://www.mastersindatascience.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/05/tree-graphic.jpg width=500/>\n\nA tree can be “learned” by splitting the source set into subsets based on an attribute value test. This process is repeated on each derived subset in a recursive manner called recursive partitioning. The recursion is completed when the subset at a node all has the same value of the target variable, or when splitting no longer adds value to the predictions.Decision trees classify instances by sorting them down the tree from the root to some leaf node, which provides the classification of the instance. An instance is classified by starting at the root node of the tree, testing the attribute specified by this node, then moving down the tree branch corresponding to the value of the attribute as shown in the above figure. This process is then repeated for the subtree rooted at the new node. \nThe decision tree in above figure classifies a particular morning according to whether it is suitable for playing tennis and returning the classification associated with the particular leaf.(in this case Yes or No).
